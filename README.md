## Set up

This project is divided in two main parts. There is the web application and our router used in our firebase console through a cloud function (as you can see in the firebase documentation clicking [here]([https://www.figma.com/file/f1hUvDjGJOyvWnQnPnrROc/myCompany?node-id=0%3A1](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/functions#use_a_web_framework))).

### Web App

You can launch this project using any navigator (we advice you to avoid Safari, all tests have been done on Chrome). You need to launch the application from the app folder of our repository by using `yarn` to install the dependencies of the project. Then `yarn start` to launch Expo then click on `Run on web browser` or run `yarn start web`
